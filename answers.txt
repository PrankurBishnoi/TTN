//Q9.Which method on the session object can be used to remove an object from the cache?

evict method is used


//Q10.What does @transactional annotation do?
@Transactional

it make sure that the method or class or interface must follow the database rules, either the whole transaction should occur or none of it.
if any sort of exception occurs the whole transaction should roll back.
also it maintains a hibernate session

e.g

try{
    userTransaction.start();
    businessLogic();
    userTransaction.commit();
} catch(Excepton ex) {
    ex.rollback();
}
